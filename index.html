    Hyderabad is considered the main pearl trading centre in India, because of which the city is also known as the "City of Pearls". The most notable area devoted to the trade is the village called Chandanpet just outside Hyderabad, wherein almost the entire population is engaged in the delicate art of drilling pearls, a skill they have practiced for generations. This practice also makes the city one of the largest pearl drilling locations in India.
